        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Faisal Al-Qadh, born in Madina on July 5th, 1987, and raised in the royal city of Yanbu until middle school. 
            I later moved to Mecca, where I attended high school and began my academic journey at Umm Al-Qura University, studying mechanical engineering. 
            Subsequently, I moved to India to study pharmacy at Rajiv Gandhi University and later completed my degree in electrical engineering at Tennessee Tech University in the USA.
        </p>
        <p>
            Professionally, I joined SLB in 2014, where I have held several significant roles, showcasing my skills in engineering, leadership, and recruitment.
